# happierday

MEAN stack project

encountered the prrblem with node v8, the link doesn't work anymore.
deployment url: https://happierday.herokuapp.com

Install node and mongodb

npm install nodemon and @angular-cli globally

npm install to install dependencies for both server and client, need to run npm install in two different directories

after npm install for client finished, go ng build to build the angular front end

on the root directory, run mongod --dbpath D:\happierday-test, either drive will be fine

then run nodemon cmd
